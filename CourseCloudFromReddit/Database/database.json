				["CS course difficulty vs Math courses difficulty","Math courses in general are harder than cs courses, because it requires more abstract thinking as you take upper year math courses. As a cs specialist, I got very good mark in mat137, 223, 235 and 224.. But I decided to not go into further study in mathematics, because most of 300 level mat courses require that you have taken 257/246 or got really good mark in 237.... I would have to say mat257 is harder than any cs courses... yes including csc373...","https://redd.it/7fhhle"],
				["How hard is it to do well in the math and CS specialists?","I actually did this before as well somewhere in the archives, but here's a better attempt at quantitatively answering your question. I'm only using publicly available data here.\n\nUpshot: students in MAT257 can expect do get a grade that's about 8 points below what they got in MAT157, probably.\n\nThe averages in both MAT157 and MAT257 in the years that I took them were both C+. About half the number of students who finish MAT157 end up finishing MAT257. \n\nI'm modelling the probability of completing MAT257 as 1/(1+exp(1.7-10*((mark-50)/100))), where mark is the mark in MAT157.\n\nThis gives a probability of 15% for completing MAT257 if you got a 50 in MAT157, a probability of 78% of completing MAT257 if you got an 80 in MAT157, and a probability of 91% of completing MAT257 if you got a 90 in MAT157. This I think sounds vaguely plausible, though that's just a guess.\n\nIf the model is right, you will get about half of the people who complete MAT157 completing MAT257.\n\nIf the model is right, the average in MAT157 of the people completing MAT257 is about a 76, which means that you can expect to get a mark that's about 8 points lower in MAT257 than what you got in MAT157, on average.\n\nI didn't repeat the same thing for MAT347/MAT357. My intuition is that marks stabilize by third year, but I'm not sure.\n\n\n        #Generate random grades with mean 68 and sd of slightly less than 15\n        \n        d157 <- rnorm(100000, mean=68, sd=15)\n        d157[d157>100]=100\n        d157[d157<0]=0\n        \n        \n        #Probability of completing 257 given a mark in 157\n        p_stay <- function(mark){\n          return(( 1/(1+exp(1.7-10*((mark-50)/100))))  * (mark >= 50))\n        }\n        \n        \n        #Sanity check: compute the probabilities of completing MAT257\n        #              given that marks in 157\n        cat(p_stay(c(50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95)))\n        #0.1544653 0.3318122 0.5744425 0.785835 0.908877 0.9426758\n        \n        #Sanity check: compute the proportion of people who completed\n        #157 who go on to complete 257\n        \n        rbernoulli <- function(prob){\n          return(rbinom(n=1, prob=prob, size=1))\n        }\n        \n        stay <- sapply(p_stay(d157), FUN=rbernoulli)\n        \n        cat(mean(stay))\n        #0.51 -- about right\n        \n        \n        #Compute the mean grade in MAT157 for people who completed MAT257\n        mean(d157[stay==1])\n        #76.2\n","https://redd.it/6ngqm4"],

However, the nice thing about math is that while it is very hard, the evaluation system is pretty cut and dried and you won't lose very many marks \"unfairly\", if any. What I mean by this is that in humanities courses you can lose marks on what amounts to style, or that can change based on who is reading it. In math, any time you lose a mark, you can go talk to the prof or whoever marked it, and either THEY made a mistake and will change it, or you made a mistake and will realize where it was.\n\nMath specialist courses almost all require some degree of creativity. Also, the workload for 347 is HUGE, don't take it lightly. If you are planning to cruise through, simply don't take them, you won't. If you plan to give them time though, 347 is one of if not the most rewarding course I took.","https://redd.it/6ngqm4"],
