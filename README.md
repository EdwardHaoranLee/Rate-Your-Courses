# UofTCourse

This is a side project initialized by Jasmine (Jingyi) Sun and Edward (Haoran) Li. This project is started with the mission of helping undergraduate student in University of Toronto to make a better decision when enrolling courses for each semester. Mission is achieved by organizing and analyzing the public data from reddit.com/r/uoft, the subreddit for U of T. The project is presented in a form of [website](rateyourcourses.ca), and consists two major parts: frontend (by Jasmine) and backend (by Edward). 

This project is entirely non-commercial and open-source. We encourage everyone to utilize any code within it and make a better product for everyone and anyone in this world.

This repository contains:
1. The [backend folder](CourseCloudFromReddit) where contains all the Python code to process the raw data from reddit.
